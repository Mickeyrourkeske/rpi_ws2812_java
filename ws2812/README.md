# Raspberry Pi ws2812 Library

The library uses ws2812 as the underlying driver. It's a C library from https://github.com/626Pilot/RaspberryPi-NeoPixel-WS2812, although I've taken the modified version from [Pimoroni](https://github.com/pimoroni/unicorn-hat)

I used [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) to generate the JNI bindings.
